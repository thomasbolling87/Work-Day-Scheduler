Work DAy Scheduler

Task is to make a simple calendar that will allow a user to add task to the calendar, and save the task
to the localStorage using JSON. The layout must include APIs such as Bootstrap and Jquery.

Building the base of the HTML, allows me to use the setup information from the Bootstrap site post
adding in the scripts. 

It took some research to figure out the best way for me to under stand how to make this work.
I am quite sure there are shorter and easier ways to complete this task, but I used the simpliest way that I know how.
